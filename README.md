# Abacus

A modern desktop calculator.

## Features

Abacus is a desktop calculator with many capeabilities. Currently, Abacus is dependent on the capeabilities of the 
Kalker rust crate (its essentially a glorified wrapper around this crate). Future versions of Abacus will use a more
extensive fork of this crate.

## Developing
Abacus is developed using Svelte and Rust. After downloading Node.js and Rust, run the following command to start the
development server.

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building
To build binaries for all platforms run the following.

```bash
npm run build
```
